                    <p class="lead">Keeping your ship documents always "on course".</p>

                    <p>In modern shipping, the complete maintenance of documents and certificates is crucial – whether
                        for audits, inspections, reflagging or daily operations. MareSphere takes over the professional
                        management of all ship and operationally relevant documents for you.</p>

                    <h3>Our Services Include:</h3>
                    <ul class="service-list">
                        <li>We organize and structure your technical documents, certificates and drawings – digital or
                            classic.</li>
                        <li>We keep track of deadlines for inspections, audits and certificate renewals, remind you in
                            time of upcoming measures and actively support preparation and implementation. Just as you
                            like.</li>
                        <li>For reflagging, classification changes, class inspections or flag state inspections and IMCA
                            audits as well as third-party inspections, we accompany you from application to successful
                            acceptance. We check, coordinate and arrange and ensure complete tracking.</li>
                        <li>If desired, we create practical audit templates and checklists from your existing
                            documentation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Your Advantage:</strong> You save time and nerves, avoid unnecessary effort and minimize
                        risks from missing or incorrect documents. MareSphere helps ensure your ship is always ready and
